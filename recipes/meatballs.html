    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"These Ricotta Meatballs are an easy and delicious family favorite! Tender, juicy homemade meatballs with a jar of good marinara and a crispy topping to finish it all off. YUM!"</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb ground turkey</li>
        <li>1/2 cup full-fat ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Panko</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Mix all meatball ingredients together.</li>
        <li><strong>Meatballs:</strong> Roll mixture into 20-24 small meatballs. Drizzle some olive oil in the bottom of a shallow Dutch oven or oven-safe pan to prevent sticking. Put the meatballs in the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 20-25 minutes on a middle oven rack. Gently loosen them from the bottom of the pan with a spatula; they should have some nice browning.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> Add the tomato sauce directly to the pan with the meatballs and stir to get them all coated. </li>
        <li><strong>Optional Topping:</strong> Mix the 1/4 cup panko, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 2 teaspoons olive oil, and parsley in a small bowl. Sprinkle on top of the meatballs and sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Final bake:</strong> Return to the oven for 5-7 minutes to warm the sauce. Turn on the broiler for the last 2-3 minutes to get the crispies nice and golden (just watch it so it doesnâ€™t burn).</li>
        <li><strong>You're Done!</strong> Get into this! SO good served with a green salad and garlic bread for dunking into the sauce!</li>
    </ol>
